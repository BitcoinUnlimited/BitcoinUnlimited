Bitcoin Unlimited RPM spec file
===============================

The RPM spec file in this directory is an example that can be used to to create
RPM packages for Bitcoin Unlimited on RPM based GNU/Linux distributions.

The specific RPM spec file here has been tested on CentOS 7.3 x86\_64 and works
to create packages that successfully update Bitcoin-Core 0.13.0 packages.

Source files for SELinux support are included in this directory, as well as an
SVG file obtained from WikiMedia that can be used to create both GNOME and KDE
desktop files.

Have at it.
