Setup
---------------------
[Bitcoin Unlimited](http://www.bitcoinunlimited.info) is a fork of the original Bitcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.  It downloads and stores the entire history of Bitcoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
