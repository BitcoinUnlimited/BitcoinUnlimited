  <https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues>

This is a minor release version based of Bitcoin Unlimited compatible
with the Bitcoin Cash specification you could find here:

https://github.com/Bitcoin-UAHF/spec/blob/master/uahf-technical-spec.md


Upgrading
---------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from a release older than 1.1.2.0, your UTXO database will be converted
to a new format. This step could take a variable amount of time that will depend
on the performance of the hardware you are using.

Downgrade
---------

In case you decide to downgrade from BUcash 1.2.0.0 to a version older than 1.1.2.0
will need to run the old release using `-reindex-chainstate` option so that the
UTXO will be rebuild using the previous format.

Main Changes
------------

The main changes of this release is the introduction of the cashaddr new address format.
The specification for this new address encoding could be find [here](https://github.com/Bitcoin-UAHF/spec/blob/master/cashaddr.md).
The old format continue to be supported and won't be deprecated, The old format will remain the default till January 14th, 2017, on
that day the new format will be used as default new format automatically.
A command line flag `-usecashaddr` and configuration parameter could be used to select which format to by default.

Add limited support to BitPay Bitcoin Cash [addresses format](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004671663-BitPay-s-Adopted-Conventions-for-Bitcoin-Cash-Addresses-URIs-and-Payme), this new format is accepted in any time an address is requested, and you can show the BitPay address form using the `getaddressforms` RPC. However BitPay-form addresses are not displayed in the GUI or as responses to any other RPCs.

Other notable changes:

- Activate the new DAA by height instead of MTP (removal of `newdaaactivationtime` parameter)
- Cash net magic became mandatory. Peers incoming connections using the old magic would be rejected.
- Coin cache improvements
- `satoshi` field added to any RPC call that returns an `amount`. The `satoshi` field is the amount in satoshis (as an integer). This field makes scripting easier since script authors do not need to use "perfect" fraction libraries such as financial decimal or binary coded decimal numbers.
- Add two RPC calls allow importing multiple watch-only addresses (importaddresses) and private keys (importprivatekeys) and supercede importaddress and importprivkey. The wallet rescan required after an import can now take hours, causing the original commands to time out and render it very difficult to import many addresses or keys. These new commands allow batching of multiple addresses or private keys, allowing all addresses and private keys to be imported in one step. Also, the rescan operation occurs asynchronously, so the RPC command returns right away rather than timing out. Your script can determine the status of the rescan by running "getinfo" and looking at the new "status" field.
- Add verbose "getstat" that returns a timestamp for reported statistics. And report the correct statistics regardless of system time changes (on platforms that support `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`)
