Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.12.0

Because release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every
fresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with
pre-0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.

If you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later,
you will need to reindex when you first start Bitcoin Core version 0.11 or
earlier.

Notable changes
===============

Example item
---------------------------------------

Example text.


- Full UTF-8 support in the RPC API. Non-ASCII characters in, for example,
  wallet labels have always been malformed because they weren't taken into account
  properly in JSON RPC processing. This is no longer the case. This also affects
  the GUI debug console.

- Command line and config option checking improvements (ported from Classic; see
  https://zander.github.io/posts/20170220-Whatsnew/).  Using non-existent options
  is no longer ignored but produces a hard error; inputs are properly validated, and
  yes/no, false/true, 0/1 all now work consistently.
  Obsolete command line and config arguments 'rpcssl' ,'socks', 'debugnet', 'tor',
  'benchmark' and 'whitelistalwaysrelay' now give a hard error about an unknown option.

C++11
-----

Various code modernizations have been done. The Bitcoin Unlimited code base has
started using C++11. This means that a C++11-capable compiler is now needed for
building. Effectively this means GCC 4.7 or higher, or Clang 3.3 or higher.

When cross-compiling for a target that doesn't have C++11 libraries, configure with
`./configure --enable-glibc-back-compat ... LDFLAGS=-static-libstdc++`.

RPC low-level changes
----------------------

- `gettxoutsetinfo` UTXO hash (`hash_serialized`) has changed. There was a divergence between
  32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and the txids were missing in the hashed data. This has been
  fixed, but this means that the output will be different than from previous versions.

Detailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect
behavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates. For convenience in locating
the code changes and accompanying discussion, both the pull request and
git merge commit are mentioned.

### RPC and REST

Asm script outputs replacements for OP_NOP2 and OP_NOP3
-------------------------------------------------------

OP_NOP2 has been renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by [BIP
65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki)

OP_NOP3 has been renamed to OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY by [BIP
112](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki)

The following outputs are affected by this change:
- RPC `getrawtransaction` (in verbose mode)
- RPC `decoderawtransaction`
- RPC `decodescript`
- REST `/rest/tx/` (JSON format)
- REST `/rest/block/` (JSON format when including extended tx details)
- `bitcoin-tx -json`

### Configuration and command-line options

### Block and transaction handling

### P2P protocol and network code

The p2p alert system has been removed in #7692 and the 'alert' message is no longer supported.

### Validation

### Build system

### Wallet

### GUI

### Tests and QA

### Miscellaneous
