Release Notes for Bitcoin Unlimited Cash Edition 1.4.0.0
=========================================================

Bitcoin Unlimited Cash Edition version 1.4.0.0 is now available from:

  <https://bitcoinunlimited.info/download>

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues>

This is a major release version based of Bitcoin Unlimited compatible
with the Bitcoin Cash specifications you could find here:

https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/spec/blob/master/uahf-technical-spec.md (Aug 1st Protocol Upgrade, bucash 1.1.0.0)
https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/spec/blob/master/nov-13-hardfork-spec.md (Nov 13th Protocol Upgrade, bucash 1.1.2.0)
https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/spec/blob/master/may-2018-hardfork.md (May 15th Protocol Upgrade, bucash 1.3.0.0, 1.3.0.1, 1.4.0.0)

A subsequent release containing the implementation of the November 2018 specification will be released soon after this one.

Upgrading
---------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from a release older than 1.1.2.0, your UTXO database will be converted
to a new format. This step could take a variable amount of time that will depend
on the performance of the hardware you are using.

Downgrade
---------

In case you decide to downgrade from BUcash 1.2.0.1, or greater, to a version older than 1.1.2.0
will need to run the old release using `-reindex` option so that the
UTXO will be rebuild using the previous format. Mind you that downgrading to version
lower than 1.1.2.0 you will be split from the rest of the network that are following
the rules activated Nov 13th 2017 and May 15th 2018 protocol upgrades.

Main Changes
------------

- Graphene Relay: A protocol for efficiently relaying blocks across a blockchain's network (experimental, turned off by default, set `use-grapheneblocks=1` to turn it on)
- blocksdb: Add leveldb as an alternative storage method for blocks and undo data (experimental, on-disk blocksdb data formats may change in subsequent releases, turned off by default)
- Double Spend Relaying
- BIP 135: Generalized version bits voting
- clean up shadowing/thread clang warn
- Update depends libraries
- Rework of the Bitcoin fuzzer command line driver tool
- Add stand alone cpu miner to the set of binaries
- Cashlib: create a shared library to make creating wallets easier (experimental, this library factors useful functionality out of bitcoind into a separate shared library that is callable from higher level languages. Currently supports transaction signing, additional functionality TBD)
- Improve QA machinery (travis mainly)
- Port Hierarchical Deterministic wallet (BIP 32)
- add space-efficient mining RPC calls that send only the block header, coinbase transaction, and merkle branch: getminingcandidate, submitminingsolution
