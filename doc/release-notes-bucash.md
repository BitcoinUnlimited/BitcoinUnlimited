This is a major release version based of Bitcoin Unlimited compatible
with the Bitcoin Cash specifications you could find here:

- https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/uahf-technical-spec.md (Aug 1st '17 Protocol Upgrade, bucash 1.1.0.0)
- https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/nov-13-hardfork-spec.md (Nov 13th '17 Protocol Upgrade, bucash 1.1.2.0)
- https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/may-2018-hardfork.md (May 15th '18 Protocol Upgrade, bucash 1.3.0.0, 1.3.0.1, 1.4.0.0)
- https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/2018-nov-upgrade.md (Nov 15th '18 Protocol Upgrade, bucash 1.5.0.0, 1.5.0.1)

This release will also implement a set of consensus changes proposed by an alternative implementation, Bitcoin SV,
see [SV release notes for ver 0.1.0](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md) for more details.
Such set of features is **disabled by default**, the default policy is to activate the set of changes as defined by the bitcoincash.org
[specification](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/2018-nov-upgrade.md).

To configure your BUcash client so that it will activate the protocol upgrade proposed by SV you need to add `consensus.forkNov2018Time=0` and `consensus.svForkNov2018Time=1`
in your `bitcoin.conf` file. Trying to activate both protocol upgrades at the same time will lead to the client to exit with this error
message: `Both the SV and ABC forks are enabled.  You must choose one.`

Upgrading
---------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from a release older than 1.1.2.0, your UTXO database will be converted
to a new format. This step could take a variable amount of time that will depend
on the performance of the hardware you are using.

Other than that upgrading from a version lower than 1.3.0.0 your client is probably stuck
on a minority chain and need some manual intervention to make so that it follow the majority
chain after the upgrade. For more detail please look at `reconsidermostworkchain` RPC commands.

Downgrade
---------

In case you decide to downgrade from BUcash 1.2.0.1, or greater, to a version older than 1.1.2.0
will need to run the old release using `-reindex` option so that the
UTXO will be rebuild using the previous format. Mind you that downgrading to version
lower than 1.1.2.0 you will be split from the rest of the network that are following
the rules activated Nov 13th 2017, May 15th 2018 and Nov 15th 2018 protocol upgrades.

Main Changes
