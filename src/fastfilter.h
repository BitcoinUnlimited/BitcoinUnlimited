/**
 * FastFilter is a probabilistic filter.  The filter can answer whether an element
 * definitely is NOT in the set, but only that an element is LIKELY in the set.
 * This is similar to a Bloom filter, but much faster.
 *
 * This filter expects that the input elements have a random distribution (i.e. hashes), and so does not hash the
 * input again.  This is how it gains the majority of its performance improvement.
 *
 * This class can be used anywhere a Bloom filter is used so long as the input data is random.
 *
 * If NUM_HASH_FNS is 16 and FILTER_SIZE is >= 64k all bits in the uint256 input data will be used to set bits in
 * the filter.  If these fields are set to lower numbers, fewer bits may be used (although in the NUM_HASH_FNS case
 * execution will be faster).  Therefore, if this structure is used in an application that accepts externally created
 * uint256 numbers that are sensitive to deliberately constructed collisions, be sure to keep NUM_HASH_FNS high enough
 * that the creation of collisions in the used bits is not feasible.
 *
 * Note also that the input bits are used without obfuscation or mixing so if an attacker can control some input bits
 * the attacker can cause collisions in some of the fast filter entries for his inputs.  This will cause higher false
 * positive rates for these transactions.  For example, if the attacker can control 32 bits of the input, he can
 * effectively reduce the number of hash functions in the fast filter by 2 because he has engineered a guaranteed
 * collision for the two functions that use those bits.
 *
 * This class is thread-safe in the sense that simultaneous calls to member functions will not crash,
 * but "inserts" may be lost.  However, if you are using this class as an in-ram filter before doing a more expensive
 * operation, a lost insert may be acceptable.
 *
 * FILTER_SIZE must be a power of 2, and NUM_HASH_FNS may range from 2 to 16 inclusive.  Since hashes are calculated
 * in pairs of 2, odd values of NUM_HASH_FNS are rounded down.
