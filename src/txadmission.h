/**
 * Filter for transactions that were recently rejected by
 * AcceptToMemoryPool. These are not rerequested until the chain tip
 * changes, at which point the entire filter is reset. Protected by
 * cs_recentRejects
 *
 * Without this filter we'd be re-requesting txs from each of our peers,
 * increasing bandwidth consumption considerably. For instance, with 100
 * peers, half of which relay a tx we don't accept, that might be a 50x
 * bandwidth increase. A flooding attacker attempting to roll-over the
 * filter using minimum-sized, 60byte, transactions might manage to send
 * 1000/sec if we have fast peers, so we pick 120,000 to give our peers a
 * two minute window to send invs to us.
 *
 * Decreasing the false positive rate is fairly cheap, so we pick one in a
 * million to make it highly unlikely for users to have issues with this
 * filter.
