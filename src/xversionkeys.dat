# XVersion key and type table
# This is auto-processed into e.g. xversionkeys.h by
# the contrib/devtools/xversionkeys.py script
# This file has to have ASCII encoding!

# value types so far:
# vector: any sized vector<uint8_t> (no further interpretation)
# u64c: unsigned 64-bit integer, compact size encoded within the vector<uint8_t> value
#
# special value types by implementations are to be prefixed with the implementation's
# short handle in lowercase and an underscore, so e.g. abc_integer, xt_string, bcash_address

#parsing marker (KEY for now)
#   key name
#    type of key ('i'nitial or 'c'hangeable?) (only i supported for now)
#                                             16 bit prefix (currently)
#                                                                      16 bit suffix  <value type>
