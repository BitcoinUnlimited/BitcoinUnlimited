/* The request manager creates an isolation layer between the bitcoin message processor and the network.
It tracks known locations of data objects and issues requests to the node most likely to respond.  It monitors responses
and is capable of re-requesting the object if the node disconnects or does not respond.

This stops this node from losing transactions if the remote node does not respond (previously, additional INVs would be
dropped because the transaction is "in flight"), yet when the request finally timed out or the connection dropped, the
INVs likely would no longer be propagating throughout the network so this node would miss the transaction.

It should also be possible to use the statistics gathered by the request manager to make unsolicited requests for data
likely held by other nodes, to choose the best node for expedited service, and to minimize data flow over poor
links, such as through the "Great Firewall of China".

This is a singleton class, instantiated as a global named "requester".

The P2P message processing software should no longer directly request data from a node.  Instead call:
requester.AskFor(...)

After the object arrives (its ok to call after ANY object arrives), call "requester.Received(...)" to indicate
successful receipt, "requester.Rejected(...)" to indicate a bad object (request manager will try someone else), or
"requester.AlreadyReceived" to indicate the receipt of an object that has already been received.
