What is Bitcoin?
=====================================

Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Unlimited is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Unlimited software, see https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/download, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/bitcoin.pdf).

What is Bitcoin Unlimited?
=====================================

Bitcoin Unlimited is an implementation of the Bitcoin client software that is based on Bitcoin Core.
However, Bitcoin Unlimited has a very different philosophy than Core.

It follows a philosophy and is administered by a formal process described in the [Articles of Federation](http://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/BUarticles.pdf).
In short, we believe in market-driven decision making, emergent consensus, and giving our users choices.
